# Credit_Risk_Model

◦ Developed a credit risk prediction model using the _**GiveMeSomeCredit**_ dataset (Kaggle) to classify customers based on default risk. 
◦ Conducted rigorous data preprocessing, including duplicate removal, imputation of missing values using mode and median, and outlier treatment for features like _**Number of dependents, Monthly Income, Revolving Utilization Of Unsecured Lines, Debt Ratio**_ etc.
◦ I used multiple **distributions** of feature like _**Monthly Income, Debt Ratio**_ and visualized some other variables using **histograms** and **boxplots** to guide data cleaning decisions.
◦ Then I trained an XGBoost Classifier on the cleaned dataset, predicted the values, and achieved an **accuracy of _~94.6%_**. 
◦ Evaluation of the model was done using confusion matrix and classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).
◦ This project demonstrates applied ML for real-world credit scoring.
