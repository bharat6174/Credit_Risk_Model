# Credit_Risk_Model

Developed a credit risk prediction model using the _GiveMeSomeCredit_ dataset (Kaggle) to classify customers based on default risk. Conducted rigorous data preprocessing, including duplicate removal, imputation of missing values using mode and median, and outlier treatment for features like _Number of dependents, Monthly Income, Revolving Utilization Of Unsecured Lines, Debt Ratio_ etc.
Explored feature distributions and visualized key variables using histograms and boxplots to guide data cleaning decisions.
Trained an XGBoost Classifier on the cleaned dataset. Achieved an accuracy of ~94.6%, with model evaluation performed using confusion matrix and classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).
This project demonstrates applied ML for real-world credit scoring.
